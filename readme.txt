Chat with customers on your website using the top rated LiveHelpNow Chat System.

== Description ==

LiveHelpNow is a responsive, reliable, and extremely affordable [Help Desk Software](http://www.livehelpnow.net/) for your website. The live chat button plugin adds click-to-chat functionality to your website, allowing you to interact directly with website visitors the same way you would in a traditional retail store. You wouldn't ignore customers in your store, so don't ignore the ones visiting your site every day!
Chat with customers using any computer or mobile device and monitor website visitors in real-time using our [Top Rated Chat System](http://www.livehelpnow.net/help-desk-software/). Invite visitors to chat automatically or proactively, help them with product selection, and increase sales! When you're unavailable the chat button plugin switches to an 'offline mode' that allows visitors to leave you messages.
This plugin is exclusively for the LiveHelpNow Chat System & also integrates seamlessly with:
* LiveHelpNow Ticket System* LiveHelpNow Callback Request System**Ticket System** - manage customer inquiries from start to finish; avoid the chaos and pitfalls of email.LiveHelpNow [Ticket System](http://www.livehelpnow.net/products/ticket_system/) is an advanced inquiry management system that provides your website with its own helpdesk solution. Instead of sending you a string of emails your customers can submit their inquiries directly into the Ticket system using a customizable web form & then get instant confirmation that their request has been received. Automated status notifications keep customers in the loop and analytical reports gauge the effectiveness of your support team. The Ticket system allows your store to be open even when you're not there, giving you the ability to provide customer service 24/7/365.
**Callback Request System** - a missed phone call can very easily be a lost sale!
You wouldn't leave your business telephone without an answering machine; now there's no reason to leave visitors to your website without a way to leave a message for you. Our 24/7 Callback Request system allows your customers to notify you when they need to speak with a live operator. Collect the person's contact information and the time at which they'd like you to call them on a customizable web form and assign callbacks to your staff; requests are then queued and for easy and straightforward management.**Full Feature List:**
